  <h2>Longer text</h2>

  <p>In a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire
  to call to mind, there lived not long since one of those
  gentlemen that keep a lance in the lance-rack, an old buckler, a
  lean hack, and a greyhound for coursing. An olla of rather more
  beef than mutton, a salad on most nights, scraps on Saturdays,
  lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra on Sundays, made
  away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it went in a
  doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match for
  holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best
  homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece
  under twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used
  to saddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook.</p>

  <p>The age of this gentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he
  was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser
  and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was Quixada
  or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among
  the authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable
  conjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This,
  however, is of but little importance to our tale; it will be
  enough not to stray a hair's breadth from the truth in the
  telling of it.</p>

  <h2>Lists</h2>

  <p>Here's an example of an ordered list:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>First element</li>

    <li>Second element</li>

    <li>Third element</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here's an example of an unordened list:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>An element</li>

    <li>Another element</li>

    <li>Yet another element</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quotes</h2>

  <p>Here's an example of a block quote:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>&ldquo;All that is gold does not glitter, Not all those who
    wander are lost; The old that is strong does not wither, Deep
    roots are not reached by the frost.</p>

    <p>From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the
    shadows shall spring; Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
    The crownless again shall be king. &rdquo;</p>

    <p>&mdash;J.R.R Tolkien</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h3>Pre-formatted text</h3>

  <p>Here's an example of the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag</p>

  <p>Below you will find a block of pre-formatted text:</p>

  <h3>Horizontal rule</h3>

  <p>Sometimes it's useful to divide two pieces of content with a
  horizontal rule:</p>
  <hr>

  <p>Yes, just like that</p>
